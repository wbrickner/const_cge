# `const_cge`: Neural Network Compiler

## Disclaimer: crate slightly broken for now

![Cover graphic depicts transformation of a neural network to a rust function](./images/cover.png)

# What do?

`const_cge` performs a symbolic evaluation of your neural network at compile time, producing efficient rust code with identical behavior.

With the information about data dependencies inside the network available, 
LLVM is able to perform more advanced optimizations, like instruction ellision, 
pipeline-aware reordering, SIMD vectorization, register + stack size minimization, and more.

The generated rust code: 
- will never allocate, panic, or rely on `std` constructs
- has input and output dimensions which are statically declared
- has internal data dependencies that are statically analyzable
- utilizes an exactly minimal recurrent state array, or none at all (only pay for what you use)
- statically captures properties of your neural network in the type system
- incurs zero overhead cost at runtime

Check out [`eant2`](todo) to see how to train a neural network compatible with `const_cge`.

# Simple Example

## Network
The `network` macro statically generates all of the fields and functions required to evaluate our network:

```rust
/// Use sensor data to control the limbs of a robot
#[network("nets/walk.cge")]
struct Walk;

let mut walk = Walk::default();

// I/O is statically sized to match our network
walk.evaluate(&input, &mut output);
```

# Compile Time Guarantees
## Nonrecurrent
It is sometimes a problem if a network can squirel away information about its past states (recurrency).

You can use `nonrecurrent`, which will halt compilation if the imported network contains any recurrency:

```rust
/// Predict which lighting color would best complement the current sunlight color
#[nonrecurrent("nets/color.cge")]
struct Color;

// evaluate is now a static function.
// it has no state, and this is captured in the type system.
Color::evaluate(&input, &mut output);
```

## Recurrent
Some tasks are best solved using recurrent architectures, and the inclusion of a non-recurrent network would be a mistake.

You can use `recurrent`, which will halt compilation if the imported network contains no recurrency:

```rust
/// Detect if our device has just been dropped and is currently falling through the air
#[recurrent("nets/drop.cge")]
struct Dropped;

let mut d = Dropped::default();
d.evaluate(&input, &mut output);
```

# Recurrent State?

Recurrent state stores the previous value of a neuron for use in the next evaluation (sent backwards in the network).

The state inside a recurrent network is represented as `[f64; N]`, and is updated on every evaluation. As mentioned before, it is made only as large as it needs to be.

If you like, you can read this state, modify it, restore it later, etc.

```rust
/// Attempt to clarify audio stream
#[recurrent("nets/denoise.cge")]
struct Denoise;

// initially-zero recurrent state
let mut a = Denoise::default();

// some evaluations later, read internal state, send it to a server, etc.
let state = d.recurrent_state();
```

Review [the documentation](https://docs.rs/const_cge) for additional methods relating to recurrent state.

# Design Goals & Drawbacks

- You can accomplish quite a lot with "small" networks, especially for control tasks. `const_cge` is not intended for use in "deep learning" tasks (language modeling, etc).
- Tradeoffs that favor embedded use cases (robotics, $0.05 USD microcontrollers)
- Lots of individual `const_cge` networks in the same binary may end up being _larger_ or _slower_ than a runtime evaluation approach.
This will depend on the target machine and the networks you're evaluating. If you really care, measure. This library should cover the common use case perfectly.
